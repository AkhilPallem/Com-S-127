#Lab week 3 - Statement results 

#I think this will result in true because 7%2 is 1 and so in the minimum 
print(min(1,2,3,4,5) == 7%2)

#I think this will print 10 since it rounds to 0 
print(float(round(10.4,0)))

#I think this will print false since exponents dont match and so on 
print(pow(2,-2) == pow(2,.25))

#I think this will print 27
print(pow(float(round(3.4,0)),float(round(3.4,0))))

#I think this will print 3^4 which is 81
print(pow(max(1,2,3),min(4,5,6)))
